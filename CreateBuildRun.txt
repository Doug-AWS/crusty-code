To create a Rust project:

    cargo new PROJECT-NAME

This creates the folder PROJECT-NAME in the current folder.

Copy cargo.toml from a working code example to the PROJECT-NAME folder.
Update it as necessary.
If the "cargo build" command fails, you might have to muck with it.

Once in PROJECT-NAME:

To build the project:

    cargo build

To run the project:

    cargo run [-- -x OPTION]

To show reference docs:

    cargo doc --open

To clean out the project before adding to Git:

    cargo clean
